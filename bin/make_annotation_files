#
#   PROMOTERS
#
#   create a promoter file using approach taken for the PsychEncode enhancer dataset.
#  - generate 2kb windows upstream of the TSS
#  - intersect these windows with PFC H3K27ac (PsychEncode) and DLPFC H3K4me3 (Roadmap) ChIP-seq to create 'high confidence promoters'
#         (limit H3K27ac and H3K4me3 peaks to those with signal z-scores > 1.64, as in PyschENCODE definition)
#
#   columns: [chrom] [start] [end] [name] [score] [strand] [signalValue] [pValue] [qValue] [peak] [zScore]

#
#   ENHANCERS
#
#   enhancers defined by PsychEncode with protocol below:
#       1 curated (rDHS) regions from 449 DNase-seq encode data from human (all cell types and 
#       tissues) and these regions are in total ~2M
#           - check Figure S23 (Gerstein paper) and http://screen.encodeproject.org/index/about
#       2 quantify  open chromatin/ATAC-seq reads for all of these ~2M rDHS regions
#           - calculate z-score of height of these regions for all rDHS sites and keep only 
#             those rDHS sites which have high strength (z-score >1.64)
#           - this data is psychencode data from PFC brain region (1 sample/ control)
#       3 do the same step 2 on DHS peaks of PFC brain region from encode data
#       4 retain list of open chromatin regions (ATAC and DHS) which have strong signal in PFC
#         brain region
#       5 find regions (from step 4 regions) that are >2KB away from TSS. and quantify H3K27ac 
#         chip-seq (psychencode reference brain data)
#          - any region with z-score > 1.64 is an enhancer
#       6 similarly, find regions (from step 4) that are <2KB away from TSS and quantify H3K4me3
#         chip-seq (psychencode reference brain data)
#          - filter out the regions with z-score < 1.64 and check if H3K27ac peaks signal z-score is stronger there (>1.64)
#
#   n = 79,056 active enhancers in total
#   columns: [chrom] [start] [end] [name] [score] [strand] [signalValue] [pValue] [qValue] [peak] [zScore]
